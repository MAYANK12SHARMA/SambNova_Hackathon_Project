Users can request various types of plots, providing specific details about the data and aesthetics, and receive fully functional code tailored to their requirements.\n\nCore Functionality:\n\nUnderstand User Input: The chatbot will engage with users to gather essential information necessary for creating plots. The expected input includes:\n\nType of Plot: Users can specify the desired plot type, such as:\nScatter Plot: Ideal for visualizing relationships between two numerical variables.\nLine Plot: Useful for showing trends over time or ordered categories.\nBar Plot: Great for comparing different categories.\nHistogram: Perfect for displaying the distribution of a numerical dataset.\nBox Plot: Effective for summarizing the distribution of a dataset and identifying outliers.\nData Points: Users will provide the numeric arrays or categorical data that will be visualized in the plot.\nLabels: Users can specify titles and labels for the plot and its axes (e.g., x-axis and y-axis).\nMarkers and Aesthetics: Users can request specific visual elements, such as:\nColors: Specify colors for different elements.\nSizes: Define the size of markers or bars.\nShapes: Choose from different marker shapes or line styles.\nAdditional Options: Users can ask for features like legends, grid lines, or themes (e.g., dark mode).\nGenerate Code: Based on the gathered information, the chatbot will generate executable code snippets in either R or Python. The code will:\n\nImport necessary libraries (e.g., matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, ggplot2).\nIntegrate all user specifications into the plot.\nBe syntactically correct and ready to run without errors.\nInclude comments explaining key parts of the code for user understanding.\nOutput Format: The chatbot will return the generated code as a well-formatted string. The output will:\n\nBe easy to read and understand.\nInclude comments where necessary to clarify code functions and parameters."
